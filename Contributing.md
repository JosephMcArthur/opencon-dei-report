# Contribute to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion OpenCon Wiki!

While we've compiled our learnings from the last three years into this guide, we understand that there is always room for improvement. We hope to receive community feedback on the report, and welcome the community and members of the public to make contributions directly to the [wiki](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/wiki). Instructions on how to make contributions can be found below.
