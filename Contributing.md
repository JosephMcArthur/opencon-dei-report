# Contribute to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion OpenCon Wiki!

While we've compiled our learnings from the last three years into this guide, we understand that there is always room for improvement. We hope to receive community feedback on the report, and welcome the community and members of the public to make contributions directly to the [wiki](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/wiki) or provide more general feedback – publicly via Github, or by emailing us. 

## How to contribute

### Make edits directly on the Wiki
Is there information, resources, or corrections you'd like to make to our suggested practices for inclusive and accessible event planning? Please feel free to contribute directly to the wiki. Here are some quick instructions for contributing: 

1. Make sure you have a Github account, and are logged in.  
2. Click on the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/wiki).
3. Click on the page you want to edit using the sidebar.
4. Click the Edit button on the right hand side of the page.
5. Once you're done, scroll to the bottom and save any changes by clicking "Commit changes".   

When making edits, please make sure you are keeping consistent and using Markdown. Here's a quick cheatsheet on formatting in Markdown:https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet 

### Or – start a discussion topic, for more general concerns (rather than specific edits) 
Do you see an issue in the report but would rather have us write the copy for it? Do you have a general concern that you'd like to raise publicly for discussion before we add it to the wiki? We encourage you to [**post a new Github Issue**](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/issues). How to do this:
1. Make sure you have a Github account, and are logged in.
2. Click on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/issues). 
3. Post your comment or feedback as an Issue by clicking "New Issue" in the upper right hand corner. 
4. If appropriate, assign one of the following labels to your issue: 
- Feedback
- Discussion
- Quick Fix
- Correction
- Additional Information
- Resource/Link

We encourage the community to contribute their feedback to issues that have been raised by other community members, as well! 

### E-mail us 
If you're more comfortable providing your feedback privately, that is also an option! Please e-mail lorraine(at)sparcopen.org with any concerns, comments, or suggested changes.
