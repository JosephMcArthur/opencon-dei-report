# Contribute to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion OpenCon Wiki!

While we've compiled our learnings from the last three years into this guide, we understand that there is always room for improvement. We hope to receive community feedback on the report, and welcome the community and members of the public to make contributions directly to the [wiki](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/wiki). 

## What kinds of contributions are we looking for?
If you don't have a specific edit to make directly to the Wiki, but have a general topic you'd like to bring up without writing the copy for it, please let us know!  

## How to contribute

### Make edits directly on the Wiki


### Or – start a discussion topic, for more general concerns (rather than specific edits) 
Do you see an issue in the report but don't have the capacity to write the copy for it? Do you have a general concern that you'd like to raise publicly for discussion before we add it to the wiki? We encourage you to [**post a new Github Issue**](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/issues). How to do this:
1. Make sure you have a Github account, and are logged in.
2. Click on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/issues). 
3. Post your comment or feedback as an Issue by clicking "New Issue" in the upper right hand corner. 
4. If appropriate, assign one of the following labels to your issue: 

We encourage the community to contribute their feedback to issues that have been raised by other community members, as well! 

### E-mail us 
If you're more comfortable providing your feedback privately, that is also an option! Please e-mail lorraine(at)sparcopen.org with any concerns, comments, or suggested changes.
