# Contribute to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion OpenCon Wiki!

While we've compiled our learnings from the last three years into this guide, we understand that there is always room for improvement. We hope to receive community feedback on the report, and welcome the community and members of the public to make contributions directly to the [wiki](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon-dei-report/wiki). If you're here and want to contribute any additional information or corrections to our wiki – thank you!

### Make edits directly on the Wiki
